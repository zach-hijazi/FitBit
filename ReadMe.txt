This project is designed to take in a variety of metrics imported
in from a wearable device (e.g. FitBit, Apple Watch) and create custom plots.





Notes for devs:


1) add/stage changes to local branch
  <git add (target file name)>

2) commit changes to local branch with message
  <git commit (target file name) -m "message">

3) Push local changes to remote branch
  <git push -u https://github.com/zach-hijazi/FitBit.git>


To get remote branch to push local changes type...

<git config --get remote.origin.url> or <git remote show origin>
